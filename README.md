This project is a simple Bank Management System built in C++.
It was my first time creating a full Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) system, where I learned how to structure classes, handle user data, and implement features like deposits, withdrawals, transfers, and account management.

The project helped me understand the benefits of OOP such as code reusability, modularity, and better organization.

Itâ€™s a console-based system that simulates basic banking operations and demonstrates strong OOP design and logic implementation in C++.
